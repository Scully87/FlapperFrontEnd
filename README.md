#### The idea was to gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.

#####Technologies Used :

	- MongoDB
	- ExpressJS
	- AngularJS
	- NodeJS

#####How to use (Assuming you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) installed locally) :
----------
Clone the repository:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:scully87/fizzbuzz.git
```

Change into the directory:
```shell
$ cd fizzbuzz
```

To run tests:
```shell
$ rspec
```

Play in irb:
```shell
$ irb
 > require './lib/fizzbuzz.rb'
```
